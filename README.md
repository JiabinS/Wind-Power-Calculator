# Wind Power Calculator

Calculator and supporting material produced during a study on the feasibility of placing a Wind Turbine on Westtown School's Campus. While Westtown is a Green Ribbon School, there was no way a wind turbine would be possible on campus and the idea was scraped. Each student of Computer Science produced a report; this report represents only my own work. Data was collectively gathered. 

## Installation
Just build main.java in a folder alongside a txt containing average windspeed. This file must be formatted according to the guidelines shown in the example set. 

## Example Data


While only example windspeed is necessary for the calculation, many of other factors are very helpful to consider. These values (found in Example) were parsed from Brandywine Airport (KOQN) with a web scraper (code available on request) and represent several years of data.

## Contributing
If you find this code in any way helpful please use it however you see fit. While it's licensed under MIT; I really couldn't care less what you do with it. Sharing Alike would be nice, but not neccesary. 

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## Sample Report

Included for additonal context; example of a report that could be produced with this tool.
